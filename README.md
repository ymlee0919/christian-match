I checked the "Juegos" section from [your documentation](https://ymlee0919.github.io/christian-match/).  
Here’s a **concise summary** of the 4 games described there, translated into English, ready to update the "Available Games" section of your `README.md`:

---

## 🕹️ Available Games

- **Face to Face ("Cara a Cara")**  
  Two teams answer questions alternately. Each correct answer earns a point; incorrect answers give the opponent a chance to respond.

- **The Fast One ("El Rápido")**  
  Teams compete to answer quickly. The fastest correct response earns points.

- **Climbing ("Escalando")**  
  Teams move up a "mountain" by correctly answering questions. Each right answer advances them closer to the summit.

- **Baseball ("Béisbol")**  
  Players simulate a baseball game by correctly answering questions to run bases and score points.
